# Open ended Question

Solve this according to your own choice using Object oriented approach A common place to buy candy is from a machine. A new candy machine has been purchased for the gym, but it is not working properly. The machine sells candies, chips, gum, and cookies. You have been asked to write a program for this candy machine so that it can be put into operation. 

<b>The program should do the following:</b>

1. Show the customer the different products sold by the candy machine. 
2. Let the customer make the selection. 
3. Show the customer the cost of the item selected. 
4. Accept money from the customer. 
5. Release the item.

<b> Input: </b> The item selection and the cost of the item.

<b> Output: </b> The selected item.

A candy machine has two main components: a built-in cash register and severaldispensers to hold and release the products. 
## Cash Register: 
The register has some cash on hand, it accepts the amount from the customer, and if the amount deposited is more than the cost of the item, thenif possibleit returns the change. For simplicity, we assume that theuser deposits the money greater than or equal to the cost of the product. The cash register should also be able to show to the candy machine's owner the amount of money in the register at any given time.
## Dispenser: 
The dispenser releases the selected item if it is not empty. It should show the number of items in the dispenser and the cost of the item. 

<b>When the program executes, it must do the following:</b>
1. Show the different products sold by the candy machine. 
2. Show how to select a particular product.
3. Show how to terminate the program. 

Furthermore, these instructions must be displayed after processing each selection so that the user need not remember what to do if he or she wants to buy two or more items. Once the user has made the appropriate selection, the candy machine must act accordingly. If the user has opted to buy a product and that product is available, the candy machine should show the cost af the product and ask the user to deposit the money. If the amount deposited is at least the cost of the item, the candy machine should sell the item and display an appropriate message.
